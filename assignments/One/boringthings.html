  <h3>Avenging Spider-Man</h3>

  <p>Avenging Spider-Man is an American comic book series published monthly by Marvel Comics, featuring the adventures of the fictional superhero Spider-Man. The events in the story take place in the primary continuity of the mainstream Marvel Universe along with the events of The Amazing Spider-Man and later The Superior Spider-Man. This was the first ongoing series to feature Spider-Man as the main character besides The Amazing Spider-Man since the cancellation of Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man and the second volume of Sensational Spider-Man in December 2008 following the conclusion of the "One More Day" storyline. Avenging Spider-Man has also been instrumental in Marvel's shift towards including codes to receive free digital copies of the comic with purchased print comic books.</p>

  <p>From July 2012 to March 2014, IDW published the series Transformers: Regeneration One. It continued the Marvel Comics canceled Transformers series picking up after the final issue (#80) which was published in July 1991. 21 years later, the series (now under IDW) resumed, and featured the same artists and writer from the final issues of the original Marvel series: Simon Furman, Andrew Wildman, and Stephen Baskerville. The series was revived for the sole purpose of tying up loose ends and ended with #100 where the cover read "#100 in a four issue limited series". In January 2013, IDW began reprinting the series as a 4 volume trade paperback series.</p>
